    # Habit Builder with Behavioral Analytics
    #### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
    #### Description: Habit Builder with Behavioral Analytics is a full-stack web application designed to help users build positive habits through intelligent tracking, behavioral insights, and data-driven feedback. Unlike basic habit tracking tools, this application goes beyond simple checklists by analyzing user consistency patterns and identifying behavioral risks before habits fail.

The primary goal of this project is to solve a common real-world problem: many people start habits with motivation but struggle to maintain consistency over time. Traditional habit trackers only record completion, but they do not provide meaningful insights into performance trends or behavioral weaknesses. This project addresses that gap by integrating analytics and predictive logic into the habit-building process.

The application allows users to register, log in securely, and manage personalized habit lists. Each habit includes attributes such as category (e.g., health, productivity, learning), difficulty level, and creation date. Users can mark habits as completed daily, and the system stores this data in a relational SQL database.

One of the core features of the application is its streak tracking system. The backend calculates both current streak and longest streak by analyzing date-based completion logs. This encourages consistency and provides measurable progress indicators.
